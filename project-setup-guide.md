# Setting Up Your Chord Analyzer Project

Follow these steps to set up your chord analyzer application in PyCharm or any other editor.

## Project Setup

1. Create a new folder for your project (e.g., `chord-analyzer`)
2. Open this folder in PyCharm or your preferred editor

## File Structure

Create the following file structure:

```
chord-analyzer/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   ├── chord-analyzer.js
│   ├── ui-controller.js
│   └── chord-examples.js
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

## Copy Files from Artifacts

1. Copy all the files from the artifacts I've provided into the corresponding locations in your project structure

## Initialize Git Repository

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Chord Analyzer"
```

## Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository named "chord-analyzer"
2. Follow the instructions to push your local repository to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/chord-analyzer.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Running the Project

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the application. No server is required as everything runs client-side.

## Development Tips

- **Testing**: Test with different chord progressions to ensure consistent analysis
- **Debugging**: Use your browser's developer tools (F12) to debug any issues
- **Enhancements**: 
  - The core algorithm is in `chord-analyzer.js`
  - Add new example progressions in `chord-examples.js`
  - Adjust the UI in `index.html` and `ui-controller.js`

## Customization

If you need to adjust how the analyzer works:

1. Modify the weights in the `WEIGHTS` object in `chord-analyzer.js` to fine-tune key detection
2. Add new special case patterns to `SPECIAL_PATTERNS` for chord sequences that need special handling
3. Update the borrowed chord detection in `getBorrowedChordInfo()` to handle additional borrowed chords

## Deployment

This is a static website, so you can deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
3. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually 'main')
4. Save the settings and GitHub will provide a URL for your deployed site
